#CryptoScripts

Simple, lightweight crypto tools for the rest of us. 

<pre>Usage: ./encrypt [infile] [outfile]
./encrypt message.txt encrypted.txt
./decrypt encrypted.txt decrypted.txt
</pre>

## Installation
1. Copy files to `$PATH` (`/usr/local/bin`, etc) && `chmod +x`
2. ???
3. Profit?

Currently, it just prompts for a password. I'll be adding cipher options and other stuff later.
